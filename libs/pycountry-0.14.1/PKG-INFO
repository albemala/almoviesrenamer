        pycountry
        =========
        
        pycountry provides the ISO databases for the standards:
        
        639
          Languages
        
        3166
          Countries
        
        3166-2
          Subdivisions of countries
        
        4217
          Currencies
        
        15924
          Scripts
        
        The package includes a copy from Debian's `pkg-isocodes` and makes the data
        accessible through a Python API.
        
        Translation files for the various strings are included as well.
        
        
        Countries (ISO 3166)
        ====================
        
        Countries are accessible through a database object that is already configured
        upon import of pycountry and works as an iterable:
        
          >>> import pycountry
          >>> len(pycountry.countries)
          248
          >>> list(pycountry.countries)[0]
          <pycountry.db.Country object at 0x...>
        
        Specific countries can be looked up by their various codes and provide the
        information included in the standard as attributes:
        
          >>> germany = pycountry.countries.get(alpha2='DE')
          >>> germany
          <pycountry.db.Country object at 0x...>
          >>> germany.alpha2
          u'DE'
          >>> germany.alpha3
          u'DEU'
          >>> germany.numeric
          u'276'
          >>> germany.name
          u'Germany'
          >>> germany.official_name
          u'Federal Republic of Germany'
        
        Note that historic countries, defined by the ISO 3166-3 sub-standard are not
        included in this list.
        
        Country subdivisions (ISO 3166-2)
        =================================
        
        The country subdivisions are a little more complex than the countries itself
        because they provide a nested and typed structure.
        
        All subdivisons can be accessed directly:
        
          >>> len(pycountry.subdivisions)
          4691
          >>> list(pycountry.subdivisions)[0]
          <pycountry.db.Subdivision object at 0x...>
        
        Subdivisions can be accessed using their unique code and provide at least
        their code, name and type:
        
          >>> de_st= pycountry.subdivisions.get(code='DE-ST')
          >>> de_st.code
          u'DE-ST'
          >>> de_st.name
          u'Sachsen-Anhalt'
          >>> de_st.type
          u'State'
          >>> de_st.country
          <pycountry.db.Country object at 0x...>
        
        Some subdivisions specify another subdivision as a parent:
        
          >>> al_br = pycountry.subdivisions.get(code='AL-BU')
          >>> al_br.code
          u'AL-BU'
          >>> al_br.name
          u'Bulqiz\xeb'
          >>> al_br.type
          u'District'
          >>> al_br.parent_code
          u'AL-09'
          >>> al_br.parent
          <pycountry.db.Subdivision object at 0x...>
          >>> al_br.parent.name
          u'Dib\xebr'
        
        The divisions of a single country can be queried using the country_code index:
        
          >>> len(pycountry.subdivisions.get(country_code='DE'))
          16
        
          >>> len(pycountry.subdivisions.get(country_code='US'))
          57
        
        
        Scripts (ISO 15924)
        ===================
        
        Scripts are available from a database similar to the countries:
        
          >>> len(pycountry.scripts)
          158
          >>> list(pycountry.scripts)[0]
          <pycountry.db.Script object at 0x...>
        
          >>> latin = pycountry.scripts.get(name='Latin')
          >>> latin
          <pycountry.db.Script object at 0x...>
          >>> latin.alpha4
          u'Latn'
          >>> latin.name
          u'Latin'
          >>> latin.numeric
          u'215'
        
        
        Currencies (ISO 4217)
        =====================
        
        The currencies database is, again, similar to the ones before:
        
          >>> len(pycountry.currencies)
          182
          >>> list(pycountry.currencies)[0]
          <pycountry.db.Currency object at 0x...>
        
          >>> argentine_peso = pycountry.currencies.get(letter='ARS')
          >>> argentine_peso
          <pycountry.db.Currency object at 0x...>
          >>> argentine_peso.letter
          u'ARS'
          >>> argentine_peso.name
          u'Argentine Peso'
          >>> argentine_peso.numeric
          u'032'
        
        
        Languages (ISO 639)
        ===================
        
        The languages database is similar too:
        
          >>> len(pycountry.languages)
          486
          >>> list(pycountry.languages)[0]
          <pycountry.db.Language object at 0x...>
        
          >>> aragonese = pycountry.languages.get(alpha2='an')
          >>> aragonese.alpha2
          u'an'
          >>> aragonese.bibliographic
          u'arg'
          >>> aragonese.terminology
          u'arg'
          >>> aragonese.name
          u'Aragonese'
        
        Locales
        =======
        
        Locales are available in the `pycountry.LOCALES_DIR` subdirectory of this
        package. The translation domains are called `isoXXX` according to the standard
        they provide translations for. The directory is structured in a way compatible
        to Python's gettext module.
        
        Here is an example translating language names:
        
          >>> import gettext
          >>> german = gettext.translation('iso3166', pycountry.LOCALES_DIR,
          ...                              languages=['de'])
          >>> german.install()
          >>> _('Germany')
          'Deutschland'
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.14.1 (2011-07-15)
        -------------------
        
        - Re-release 0.14 after packaging mistake.
        
        
        0.14 (2011-07-06)
        -----------------
        
        - Update data to iso-codes 3.26.
        
        
        0.13 (2010-04-23)
        -----------------
        
        - Applied patch from Pedro Araujo which removes the somewhat superfluous
          dependency on lxml to the builtin minidom. This seems to consistently turn
          all strings into unicode even if they only contain ASCII characters.
        
        
        0.12.1 (2010-04-21)
        -------------------
        
        - Remedy brown-bag release 0.12 which was missing all data files due to a bad
          interaction between the build system for the data and zest.releaeser's
          full-release script.
        
        
        0.12 (2010-04-20)
        -----------------
        
        - Follow Debian repository to git.
        
        - Upgrade data to revision 770fa9cd603f90f9fb982b32fe6f45d253f1d33e as
          requested by #5488 and others.
        
        - Reflect subdivision changes with how they reference their parents in the XML
          (they used to use space as a separator but now use a hyphen).
        
        - Refactor index building structures a bit.
        
        - Remove superfluous 'code' index from subdivision database. (Together with
          the data upgrade this also gets rid of all the annoying warnings as
          described in #6667).
        
        - Some light PEP 8 improvements.
        
        0.11 (2009-03-03)
        -----------------
        
        - Updated Debian repository to r1752.
        
        
        0.10 (2008-06-26)
        -----------------
        
        - Added support for country subdivisions (ISO 3166-2).
